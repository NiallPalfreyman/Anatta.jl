        Welcome to Lab 618: Research and development projects

        By now, you have built up a good repertoire of skills in agent-based modelling. In the
        assessed project for this course, you will apply those skills to implement either a
        real-life development project or a research project. You can read the requirements for
        each of these two projects in the Docs folder of your Anatta sandpit.
