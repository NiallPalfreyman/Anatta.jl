        Hi! Welcome to Anatta Lab 102: Syntactic Structure and Incompleteness

        What have we achieved so far in this Subject? In labs 100 and 101, we constructed a
        language named PL (Propositional Logic) that consisted of sentences (wffs) and their
        meanings (truth-table columns). Syntax defines the structure of sentences, for example:
            (a -> (a | ~b))

        and Semantics define this sentence's meaning as the rightmost column of this truth-table:
            | a | b | ~b | (a | ~b) | (a -> (a | ~b)) |
            -------------------------------------------
            | 0 | 0 | 1  | 1        | 1               |
            | 0 | 1 | 0  | 0        | 1               |
            | 1 | 0 | 1  | 1        | 1               |

    Activity(

        We also proved that there is no gap between the wff sentences and their truth-table
        meaning, in the sense that our definition of PL is both Sound and Complete:
        -   Soundness: Every sentence (wff) has a unique meaning (truth-table column);
        -   Completeness: Every meaning is expressed by some sentence of variables linked by
                            the operators ["T","F","&","|","~","->"]

        Now, what would happen if we changed the operators that we use to define PL? For example,

        One way to prove the incompleteness of PL1 would be to find a Counterexample: a truth-table
        column that we cannot state as a wff in PL1. For example, suppose we would like to use the
        operators ["T","F","&","|"] of PL1 to construct the truth-table column for the wff ~a. We
        could for example set up the following columns:
            | a | (a & F) | (a | a) | ~a |

        column described by the wff ~a. Now you try. reply() me your true/false answer to the

        the wff "~a"?

        The set of operators in PL1 is small enough that we can try out all possible truth-table
        columns, and so discover that there is no way we can ever create a wff whose truth-table
        exactly matches that of ~a. In this way, we can prove that the language PL1, based on the
        operators ["T","F","&","|"], is Incomplete: there exists at least one meaning [~: 0->1, 1->0]
        that PL1 can Never describe in a sentence. PL1 is strictly LESS expressive than PL!

        This idea of incompleteness raises many interesting questions about syntactic structures:
        -   If we add new operators to PL, does the syntax become more expressive?
        -   Would PL still be complete if we removed, say, "&" and "|" from its definition?
        -   Could it be (Oh! Horror!) that mathematics itself is incomplete?! That is, are there
            mathematical facts that we will never be able to express in the language of mathematics?

        We shall answer ALL of these questions in this Anatta Subject! Hooray!

        First, let's take a look at some new binary operators that are regularly used in computer

        Notice that the wff standing to the left of the iff-operator is "a nand b", while the wff
        to the right of the iff-operator is the definition of nand: "not (a and b)". The name "iff"
        is short for "if, and ONLY if", so the fact that this iff-sentence is a tautology means it
        is true in ALL models that the left- and right-hand wffs have exactly the same truth-value!
        
        So (a-&b) is TRUE in precisely those situations where ~(a & b) is TRUE, and is FALSE in

        expression (a-&b) in a sentence, we can always replace it by the expression ~(a & b)

        This idea of Substitution is enormously important. It means that these four new operators

        We shall answer this question by implementing Substitution in PL. Removing AND and OR from
        the definition of PL will certainly lower PL's expressivity (and so make it incomplete)
        unless we can always substitute (a & b) and (a | b) by some other expressions in sentences
        Without changing their semantics. So let's look at a few useful substitutions ...

        And of course we all know this truth-preserving equivalence:

        To use an equivalence to perform a substitution, we must do two things: recognise the
        operator that characterises the substitution, then substitute the variables that are linked
        together by that operator. Let's make this easier to understand by looking at a concrete
        example. Suppose we rewrite De Morgan's second equivalence in the following way. What would

        the operand p corresponds to the sub-wff ~x. Having recognised this, we must then
