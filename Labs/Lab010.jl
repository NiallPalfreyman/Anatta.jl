        Hi! Welcome to Anatta Lab 010: Thinking about mathematics

        From here on in this Subject, we shall use our knowledge of computation and programming
        to think about the Mathematics. Mathematics is the scientific study of structure, and
        to understand it, we shall use the rather brilliant ideas in the small book "Mathematics
        Rebooted" by Lara Alcock (2017). Prepare to to have some fun thinking about maths ... :)

        Have you ever heard of Pythagoras's Theorem? Or Fermat's Last Theorem? These are famous
        examples of the central activity of mathematics: to prove statements about structure that
        anyone, anywhere can use to solve problems. A Theorem is simply a Provably True
        mathematical statement such as:
            Theorem: The sum of two even numbers is always even.
            Theorem: A number is divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.

        In this lab, we will learn about Pythagoras's Theorem and Fermat's Last Theorem by thinking
        about a subject you are already quite familiar with: Multiplying.

        Tell me whether you think the following statement is a true or false statement about numbers:

        Mathematicians are fundamentally lazy - in fact, they are too lazy to fail!
        
        For instance, suppose you, as a mathematician, want to memorise the times-table of numbers
        up to 10. Since 3*5 is the same as 5*3, you must only memorise the single product: 3*5 == 15

        In fact, the 1's and 10's are so easy that you actually don't need to remember them at all!

        In particular, mathematicians dislike remembering facts - they prefer to reconstruct those
        facts for themselves using general relationships. In fact,
            Mathematics is the study of Structures, and how to discover, manipulate and use them.

        Some structures are more useful than others. For example, our array of 3*5 asterisks shows
        us immediately that 3*5 == 5*3. But that is not the case for this structure of 15 asterisks:

        This brings us to another interesting point... We discover new structures by scanning our
        experience for relationships that are Invariant (i.e., stay the same) when we look at them
        in different ways. For example, look at the following alternative ways of looking at an
        array of 15 asterisks, and notice how the number (15) of asterisks does Not Vary (i.e., is
        invariant), whether we think of that array as consisting of columns or of rows:

        In fact, the entire reason why commutativity is so useful, is because it describes an
        Invariant property of products: The value of the product is invariant whether we think of
        this array as 3 rows of 5, or 5 rows of 3, asterisks. In mathematics, it is helpful if we
        can find structures like this array, that make invariances very easy to notice.

        For example, the following structure makes it easy to notice that another operation between
        numbers is also commutative. What is the name of this new commutative arithmeticoperation?

        There are a couple of things we should remember about brackets in mathematics. Let's start

            4 * (3 + 5) = (4 * 3) + (4 * 5)

        First, you may remember that we can leave out the multiplication sign in front of brackets:
            4(3 + 5) = (4 * 3) + (4 * 5)

        Also, since multiplication takes priority over addition, we could also write this as:
            4(3 + 5) = 4*3 + 4*5

        Make up your own mind which of these three forms you prefer. I like the brackets on the
        right-hand side of the first one, because they make clear the distributive structure of the
        equation. It's useful to have different notations for the same structure, because they help
        us to view that structure in different ways.
