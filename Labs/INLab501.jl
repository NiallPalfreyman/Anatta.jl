		Welcome to Lab 501!

		Now we understand the general structure of ABMs, we will turn from physics to a more
		biological example: Organisms interacting with each other in an ecosystem.

		The file Ecosystem.jl implements a model of a world in which turtles walk around and gain
		energy from eating algae, if they can find some. If a turtle gains enough energy, it will
		reproduce, and if its energy falls to zero, it will die. Algae that have been eaten by the
		turtles will also regrow with a certain specified regrowth probability.
		
		Again, I started developing this model by simply copying IdealGas.jl, then stripping out
		the functionality I wanted to change.

		One reference mode for this system is that it is sustainable: that the turtles survive and
		the algae can regrow. Run Ecosystem.demo() to verify whether it does indeed fulfil this
		reference mode.

		We will use this simple Ecosystem model to learn a bit more about how to create Agents, and
		also some useful ways of representing Agents on the screen.

		First, run the video clip a few times to get a feeling for what's happening. You can't see
		the algae yet, but you can verify that they are there by experimenting with the value of
		the model property prob_regrowth in the initialisation method ecosys(). Notice its effect
		on the turtle population.

		The circles representing the turtles don't show us which way the turtles are facing (vel),

			- In demo(), specifiy agent marker `AgentTools.wedge`;

		It would be helpful if we could see the algae and their reaction to the presence of

		already contained in the Ecosystem model property :algae, and we can easily include these
		values in the video by inserting into abmvideo() the following kwargs:
			heatarray=(model->model.algae), 						# Background map of algae
			heatkwargs=(colormap=[:black,:lime],colorrange=(0,1)),	# Algae's colours

		You should observe that for certain values of `prob_regrowth`, the numbers of turtles and
		algae converge reliably towards oscillations around a more-or-less constant value. Now,
		this may not yet seem very special to you, but it actually underlies our understanding of
		how life works. This 'decision' to converge is not made by any individual turtle, nor even
		by the population of turtles, but by the entire Ecosystem of turtles+algae. In system
		dynamics, we say that the system's "structure determines behaviour".

		There are two different kinds of system-level, structurally determined behaviour:
		"collective" and "emergent" behaviour. The oscillations of our Ecosystem are an example of
		collective behaviour: they are _determined_, but not _chosen_, by the system. "Collective"
		behaviour arises from the behaviour of many interacting individuals, but the system itself
		does not yet select between different possible individual behaviours. "Emergent" behaviour
		is less easy to define, but we will look more closely at it in the next lab. Emergence
		describes well the fact that we cannot predict YOUR behaviour based only on your individual
		component cells.

		We would like to test how reliable this collective oscillation of the Ecosystem model is, but
		at the moment it is difficult to test this because the Reset button of abmexploration()
		doesn't reinitialise the model. Try this out now: rerun the model several times and notice
		that the initial configuration of the agents is always the same...
