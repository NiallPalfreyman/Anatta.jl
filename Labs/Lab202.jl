        Hi! Welcome to Anatta Lab 202: How does Incompleteness arise?

        What have we achieved so far in this Subject? In labs 100 and 101, we constructed a
        language named PL (Propositional Logic) that consisted of sentences (wffs) and their
        meanings (truth-table columns). Syntax defines the Structure of sentences, for example:
            (a -> (a | ~b))

        and Semantics define this sentence's Meaning as the rightmost column of this truth-table:
            | a | b | ~b | (a | ~b) | (a -> (a | ~b)) |
            -------------------------------------------
            | 0 | 0 | 1  | 1        | 1               |
            | 0 | 1 | 0  | 0        | 1               |

        We also proved that there is no gap between wffs and their truth-table meaning, in the
        sense that our syntax for wffs is both Sound and Complete:
        -   Soundness: Every sentence (wff) has a unique meaning (truth-table column);
        -   Completeness: Every meaning (truth-table column) can be expressed by some wff that
                        contains variables linked by the operators ["T","F","&","|","~","->"].

        One way to prove the incompleteness of PL1 would be to find a Counterexample: a truth-table

        operators ["T","F","&","|"] of PL1 to construct the truth-table column for the wff ~a. We
        could for example set up the following columns:

        The set of operators in PL1 is small enough that we can try out all possible truth-table
        columns, and so discover that there is no way we can ever create a wff whose truth-table

        operators ["T","F","&","|"], is Incomplete: there exists at least one meaning [~: 0->1, 1->0]
        that PL1 can Never describe in a sentence. PL1 is strictly LESS expressive than PL!

        This idea of incompleteness raises many interesting questions about syntactic structures:
        -   If we add new operators to PL, does the syntax become more expressive?
        -   Is PL still be complete if we base its definition on the operators ["&","|","~"]?
        -   Could it be (Oh! Horror!) that mathematics itself is incomplete?! That is, are there
            mathematical truths that we will never be able to express in the language of mathematics?

        then use this table to translate the wff into a disjunctive normal form (DNF) that contains
        only "&", "|" and "~". So it is definitely possible to reduce the operators in PL to this
        smaller set without damaging its completeness.
        
        Yet this DNF method has a practical problem: it requires us to scan the entire semantics of
        the wff by building a truth-table. If n is the number of variables in the wff, how much
        time and memory resources would we need to build the entire truth-table?
        1.  Linear resources: O(n)
        2.  Polynomial resources: O(n^2), O(n^3), ...

        Yes, building truth-tables is Very expensive in time and other resources! For this reason,
        it is more efficient to find a way of eliminating operators syntactically. This is, indeed,
        the entire reason for doing mathematics: it helps us calculate answers structurally, that
        would otherwise take too long to answer. But of course this is only useful if we can be
        CERTAIN that our syntactic structures are complete and cover ALL possible meanings!

        We shall therefore try to use syntactic Substitution to eliminate operators syntactically
        from PL. For, removing "->" from the syntax of wffs will certainly lower their expressivity
        (by making it incomplete) unless we can always substitute (a -> b) in any wff by some other
        structure that leaves the wff's semantics unchanged. Let's look at some substitutions ...

        Wow! You can see why people prefer to use straightforward operators such as "&" and "<->"!

        Yet there is also an advantage to using a language that is defined minimally. For example,
        in this course we will base our definition of PL on precisely these two operators: ["~","->"].
        
        You might ask: Why would we do such a strange thing? Why tie one hand behind our backs, so
        to speak? The reason is that this will makes proving theorems about the language Much
        easier! Imagine what it would be like if we had to prove some exciting new property of PL
        using all of the operators ["T","F","&","|","~","->","<->","+","-&","-|"]. We would have to
        prove our new property for Every sentence that uses even just one of these operators!
        
        But with the reduced set of operators ["~","->"], life is much easier, because we know that
        all other operators can be substitutes by some combination of "~" and "->". As a result, we
        only need to prove our property for sentences that use these two. Laziness is Cool! ;)
        
        To close this lab, please use the method to_not_implies() to translate a few simple wffs
        of your choice into this new ["~","->"] version of PL, then use a truth-table to check that
        my substitution is correct. Then we will see each other again in the next lab. Have fun! :)
