        Hi! Welcome to Anatta Lab 202: How do I implement a real-life system-dynamics project?

        OK, now I have something terrible to confess. Due to compatibility issues on the julia
        package server, I have been unable to set up the laboratories for the upcoming topics
        in Subject 2, Dynamical Systems.

        For this reason, I have simply created for each lab 2 files: a script and a demo. For
        example, I have created for this lab the script file Script202.pdf, and the demo file
        ReactionKinetics.jl. Please now work through the 202 script using that demo file.
